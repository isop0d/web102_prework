## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

My main challenges were my inexperience with javascript. I spent most of my time on this project just 
trying to relearn alot of javascript syntax as I have been using mainly c++ in school. I have been 
studying a decent amount of html and css so the parts that pertained to those languages where not hard on me. However it took a decent amount of time relearning javascript aswell as learning new 
ways to implement javascript with html and css. I found myself needing to reread the challenge information section many times just to remember syntax. Despite these challenges, I feel more confident now than before doing this project.
